Specifically, the rendering window can be built with a default white background or black.  Additionally, there are several macros for controlling how much information is printed to the terminal during a build session.  \r\n\r\nOnce finished, simply run the following command in the top-level directory to build the application\r\n\r\n    make all \r\n\r\n\r\nThis will place the executable in the `build/` directory located in the top-level of this distribution.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlternatively, type the following to see a list of options available to `make`,\r\n\r\n    make help\r\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n##Usage\r\nTo see extensive documentation on the contents and how to use the code, navigate to the toplevel of this directory to the *docs/html/* directory and open the file called *index.html*.\r\n\r\nTo use the program in GUI mode, simply execute the following in a terminal,\r\n\t\r\n\t./crysb  \r\n\r\n\r\nCurrently, four options are available for using this application:\r\n\r\n###1)\r\n    Define all the relevant parameters in the *Lattice*, *Modify*, and *Output* tabs\r\n\r\n   To begin, select one of the crystals from the drop down and fill in the relevant parameters\r\n   presented in the pop-up menu.  Then nvaigate to the modify tab to define a chemical element. \r\n   If you wish to create a supercell, then fill in any of the three empty boxes.  By default, \r\n   these are set to 1x1x1, and so any of can of them be left empty.  To finish, navigate to the \r\n   *Output* tab, and select a format from the dropdown. If choosing the *LAMMPS* or *DMol* \r\n   format, then you must specify a file name, using the *Save as* button, for the *VASP* format, \r\n   this is unnecessary since the file written is named *POSCAR*.\r\n\r\n\r\n###2) \r\n    Select a library structure from the dropdown in the *Lattice* tab.\r\n\r\n   To begin, select *Library* from the *Crystals* dropdown menu.  If building one of the 2D \r\n   materials, some interaction may be necessary.  In the case of graphene, the *a* lattice \r\n   parameter is required.  For the layered (T)MDC structures, the default is to use MoS2, and \r\n   a lattice parameters of 3.19 Å for all four cases.  If you wish to build a different crystal, \r\n   then define the stoichiometry on the bottom of the *Modify* tab.  The syntax for defining the \r\n   stoichiometry is the following:\r\n\r\n   *Type1:n1,Type2:n2* i.e.  *Mo:1,S:2* or  *Sn:1,Se:2*\r\n\r\n   If you wish to create a supercell, then fill in any of the three empty boxes.  By default, these  \r\n   are set to 1x1x1, and so any of can of them be left empty.  To finish, navigate to the *Output*  \r\n   tab, and select a format from the dropdown. If choosing the *LAMMPS* or *DMol* format, then you  \r\n   must specify a file name, using the *Save as* button, for the *VASP* format, this is unnecessary  \r\n   since the file written is named *POSCAR*.\r\n\r\n\r\n###3)\r\n    Define a custom crystal with the *Custom crystal* button\r\n\r\n   To build a custom crystal, click the *Custom crystal* button in the *Lattice* tab.  A pop-up  \r\n   menu containing entries for the pertinant data will appear. In this scenario, *a,b,c* and *α,β,γ,*  \r\n   the stoichiometry and the basis have no defaults and must be explictly defined.  For the  \r\n   stoichiometry, the syntax is the as above,  \r\n\r\n   *Type1:n1,Type2:n2,Type3:n3*... i.e.  *C:3* or *Mo:1,S:2* or *C:10,H:16,N:8,O:24*    \r\n\r\n   Once the lattice paramters, angles and stoichiometry are defined, click the *Add atom* button  \r\n   to begin defining the basis.  To define the coordinates, use the fractional system and enter  \r\n   them as a comma separated field, i.e. (0.5, 0.25, 0).  To save the coordinates, hit the enter  \r\n   button after all three coordinates are defined.  If a mistake is made, hit the *Reset* button  \r\n   below this entry field.  This will reset only the basis atoms entered so far, and nothing else.  \r\n\r\n   **NOTE: The order of atoms added is relevant here and should follow the stoichiometric relationship defined above**\r\n\r\n   If you wish to create a supercell, then fill in any of the three empty boxes.  By default, these  \r\n   are set to 1x1x1, and so any of can of them be left empty.  To finish, navigate to the *Output*  \r\n   tab, and select a format from the dropdown. If choosing the *LAMMPS* or *DMol* format, then you  \r\n   must specify a file name, using the *Save as* button, for the *VASP* format, this is unnecessary  \r\n   since the file written is named *POSCAR*.\r\n\r\n###4)\r\n    Drive the application from the command line using a parameters file\r\n\r\n   To run the application in this way, you must first define the appropriate parameters in a text file\r\n   and pass this as an argument to the application from the command line as follows,\r\n\r\n    ./crysb -f parametersFile.in\r\n\r\n   A file containing all of the options required with documentation of each command can be found in the\r\n   top-level of this directory, `parametersFile.in`.\r\n\r\n###Saving/viewing\r\n\r\nAfter following the steps in **1)**, **2)**, or **3)**, you can chose to simply build the crystal and have it saved to your file.Alternatively, if the *Open GL* library was used in building this application, the crystal can be viewed in an interactive window by clicking the *Build+render* tab, see below for keyboard and mouse commands.  Upon closing this rendering window the crystal data will be written to the file you specified and the main program will terminate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**NOTE: If building a crystal with > 5000 atoms, rendering is a little slow.  Advise to use the build without rendering option.**\r\n\r\n\r\n###Crystal/scene interaction\r\n\r\n\r\n    Mouse events:\r\n      Left mouse            rotate/scale the object\r\n      Right mouse           scene display menu\r\n  \r\n    Keyboard events:\r\n        'A'                   display atoms and unit cell\r\n        'a'                   display atoms only\r\n        'B'                   display bonds, uniform nearest neighbor cutoff\r\n        'b'                   hide bonds\r\n        'C'                   increase nearest neighbor cutoff\r\n        'c'                   decrease nearest neighbor cutoff\r\n        'e'                   exit and save the data from the rendering scene\r\n        'o'                   orthographic projection of the crystal\r\n        'p'                   perspective projection of the crystal\r\n        'r' then LeftButton   rotate the crystal in all 3 dimensions\r\n        'W'                   change background to white and bounding box to black\r\n        'w'                   change background to black and bounding box to white\r\n        'z' then LeftButton   zoom toward/away from the crystal\r\n        '0'                   reset orientation of crystal to looking down z toward xy plane\r\n        '1'                   view the xz \"a-c\" plane of the crystal\r\n        '2'                   view the yz \"b-c\" plane of the crystal\r\n        '3'                   rotate crystal about x by -45˚, and then -45˚ about z, 'psuedo' perspective view\r\n        '+'                   increase the particle radius uniformly\r\n        '-'                   decrease the particle radius uniformly\r\n   \r\n        Up arrow              Shift the crystal in positive vertical screen direction\r\n        Down arrow            Shift the crystal in negative vertical screen direction\r\n        Left arrow            Shift the crystal in negative horizontal screen direction\r\n        Right arrow           Shift the crystal in positive horizontal screen direction\r\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n##Info\r\n\r\n###Author: \r\n\r\n    /**\r\n      * Joseph M.
