\begin{DoxyVerb}Crystal Builder - Simple program to build several crystal structures for use in many popular 
molecular dynamics and denisty functional theory packages.

N\+O\+T\+E\+: If you do not have the G\+T\+K+-\/2.0 libraries installed and in the usual path, i.\+e. {\ttfamily /usr/lib \& /usr/include} for Linux or as a {\ttfamily Framework} on Mac O\+S X, follow the directions below to install them.





\subsection*{Usage}

To use the program, simply execute the following in a terminal, \begin{DoxyVerb}    ./crysb  
\end{DoxyVerb}


Once the crystal has been defined and other relevant parameters are set, you can chose to simply build the crystal and have it saved to your file.

Alternatively, if the {\ttfamily Open G\+L} library was used in building this application, the crystal can be viewed in an interactive window by clicking the {\ttfamily Build+render} tab, see below for keyboard and mouse commands. Upon closing this rendering window the crystal data will be written to the file you specified and the main program will terminate.

\begin{DoxyVerb}    ** NOTE: If building a crystal with > 5000 atoms, rendering is a little slow.  Advise
             to use the build without rendering option.
\end{DoxyVerb}


\subsubsection*{Crystal/scene interaction}

\begin{DoxyVerb}    Mouse events:
      Left mouse            rotate/scale the object
      Right mouse           scene display menu
  
    Keyboard events:
        'A'                   display atoms and unit cell
        'a'                   display atoms only
        'B'                   display bonds, uniform nearest neighbor cutoff
        'b'                   hide bonds
        'C'                   increase nearest neighbor cutoff
        'c'                   decrease nearest neighbor cutoff
        'e'                   exit and save the data from the rendering scene
        'o'                   orthographic projection of the crystal
        'p'                   perspective projection of the crystal
        'r' then LeftButton   rotate the crystal in all 3 dimensions
        'W'                   change background to white and bounding box to black
        'w'                   change background to black and bounding box to white
        'z' then LeftButton   zoom toward/away from the crystal
        '0'                   reset orientation of crystal to looking down z toward xy plane
        '1'                   view the xz "a-c" plane of the crystal
        '2'                   view the yz "b-c" plane of the crystal
        '3'                   rotate crystal about x by -45˚, and then -45˚ about z, 'psuedo' perspective view
        '+'                   increase the bond radius uniformly
        '-'                   decrease the bond radius uniformly
   
        Up arrow              Shift the crystal in positive vertical screen direction
        Down arrow            Shift the crystal in negative vertical screen direction
        Left arrow            Shift the crystal in negative horizontal screen direction
        Right arrow           Shift the crystal in positive horizontal screen direction
\end{DoxyVerb}
